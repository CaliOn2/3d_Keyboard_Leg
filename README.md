3D Print File For replacement legs of a keyboard from my school because someone keeps stealing them.
Currently the legs are hard to print on a badly calibrated printer as surface contact with the build plate is low and the arms should be printed as round as possible.
print slowly and in a slightly flexible material (PLA works fine)
